# Viva notes
**One line:** Sahaay puts jobs, healthcare, sign language, an accessibility map and a community in one accessible website.

**Architecture (3 tiers):** browser (HTML/CSS/JS) -> fetch('/api/...') -> Flask blueprints -> SQLAlchemy -> SQLite/PostgreSQL.

**Demo order (5 minutes)**
1. Home, then the accessibility toolbar: font size, dark mode, high contrast, read aloud.
2. Register a new user, log out, log in again (password is hashed, session cookie).
3. Jobs: search, save, apply. Profile shows saved jobs and applications.
4. Healthcare: filter and book an appointment.
5. Community: post, like, comment, report.
6. Sign Language: play a chapter in the Learning path (watch, then quiz), open Practice flashcards, then show Achievements and the streak.
6b. Log in as employer, doctor and admin (demo accounts) to show each dashboard: post a job -> admin approves -> user applies -> employer shortlists -> user sees the status.
7. Map: tick Ramp + Elevator, click a pin, use Near me, zoom.
8. Show `python -m unittest discover tests -v` passing.

**Likely questions**
- Where is data stored? 13 tables in a relational database (schema.sql). SQLite by default, PostgreSQL through DATABASE_URL.
- Is the accessibility info private? Yes. Only /api/me returns it, to the logged-in owner. A test checks that posts never expose it.
- How is the password stored? Hashed with Werkzeug, never as plain text.
- What is not real yet? Sign-to-Text is simulated, the assistant is keyword-based, the map is a hand-drawn SVG with real coordinates. Each has a //FUTURE marker.
- Why no React? Plain HTML/CSS/JS keeps every line readable. React + Vite is the planned upgrade.
